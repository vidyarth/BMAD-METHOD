# Review Downstream Impact

**Objective:** To review the architect's research on downstream services and incorporate the findings into the product backlog and user stories.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Obtain Research Summary:**
    *   Request the research summary from the architect.

2.  **Review the Summary:**
    *   Carefully review the architect's findings on downstream services.
    *   Pay close attention to the potential impacts, risks, and challenges identified.

3.  **Update Product Backlog:**
    *   Based on the review, update the product backlog to reflect any new dependencies, risks, or constraints.
    *   This may involve creating new stories, updating existing ones, or re-prioritizing the backlog.

4.  **Refine User Stories:**
    *   For each user story that is likely to impact a downstream service, update the acceptance criteria to include any necessary integration or testing requirements.
    *   Ensure that the story clearly articulates the expected behavior of the integrated system.

5.  **Communicate with Stakeholders:**
    *   Communicate the findings and any changes to the product backlog to all relevant stakeholders, including the development team, other product owners, and business stakeholders.

6.  **Facilitate Collaboration:**
    *   Facilitate discussions between the development team and the owners of the downstream services to ensure a shared understanding of the integration requirements.

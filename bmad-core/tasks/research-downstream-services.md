# Research Downstream Services

**Objective:** To gather context about downstream services that may be impacted by the proposed changes.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Identify Potential Downstream Services:**
    *   Start by brainstorming a list of potential downstream services based on the project's context and your existing knowledge.
    *   If you are unsure, consult with the Product Owner or other team members.

2.  **Use Intuit Context MCP:**
    *   For each identified service, use the Intuit Context MCP to gather information about its purpose, ownership, and key contacts.

3.  **Use Glean MCP:**
    *   Use the Glean MCP to search for documentation, presentations, and other artifacts related to the identified downstream services.

4.  **Use GitHub MCP:**
    *   Search for the source code of the downstream services in GitHub.
    *   **CRITICAL:** When searching in GitHub, **DO NOT** use `org:intuit` in your search string. Instead, use more specific keywords related to the service name or functionality. For example, if you are looking for the "Billing Service", search for "billing service" or "billing".

5.  **Use Wiki MCP:**
    *   Search the internal Wiki for any additional documentation, design documents, or operational runbooks for the downstream services.

6.  **Synthesize Findings:**
    *   Compile the information you have gathered into a concise summary.
    *   For each downstream service, document:
        *   Its core functionality.
        *   Its key APIs and data contracts.
        *   Any known dependencies or integration points.
        *   Any potential risks or challenges related to the proposed changes.

7.  **Share Findings:**
    *   Share your summary with the Product Owner and the rest of the development team.
    *   Be prepared to discuss your findings and answer any questions.
